# Dataset 

This is a set of just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users on the site Lichess.org, and have picked this from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess). May turn out useless yet I will try extracting patterns in nature of game, openings and victory for black and white.
